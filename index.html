    <h1>OpenWeatherMap and Vue.js</h1>
    <p>This is a simple Vue.js app, fetching weather data for a user-selected location, for educational purposes. It uses the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start">Google Geocode API</a> for location suggestions based on user input or GPS position (if available), and <a href="https://openweathermap.org/api">OpenWeatherMap API</a> to render 5 days weather forecast.</p>
    <p>I also use <a href="https://vuex.vuejs.org/en/">Vuex</a> for state management, for no other reason than getting to know the workings of it. HTTP requests are handled with <a href="https://github.com/axios/axios">axios</a>. Finally, I use a local, patched version of <a href="http://sagalbot.github.io/vue-select/">Vue Select component</a>, with a <a href="https://github.com/sagalbot/vue-select/pull/512/commits/970d1da3c2fbcefeadb2ee8910cd383c98f56032">couple</a> <a href="https://github.com/sagalbot/vue-select/pull/528/commits/a1193f3c0f3fd75dd03dcd3d93d689af97b7513d">of</a> PRs baked in. It will be updated, eventually.</p>
    <p>This app was made while I learn <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">webpack</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, ES6, Vuex, <a href="https://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/expect.html">expect</a> â€” and I still have a lot to learn. I had to cheat and retrofit the tests, so this was not build with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>, but one has to start somewhere! I welcome constructive critisism and well documented PRs that whould make me, and anybody else, better developers!</p>
    <h2>TODO:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the SVGs of <a href="https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/">Weather Icons</a> instead of the font files</li>
